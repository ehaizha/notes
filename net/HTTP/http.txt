1.  HTTP pipelining is a technique in which multiple HTTP 
    requests are written out to a single socket without 
	waiting for the corresponding responses. Pipelining 
	is only supported in HTTP/1.1, not in 1.0
	
2.  Tomcat keep alive configure in server.xml
    keepAliveTimeout：
    The number of milliseconds this Connector will wait 
	for another HTTP request before closing the connection. 
	The default value is to use the value that has been set 
	for the connectionTimeout attribute.
	maxKeepAliveRequests：
	The maximum number of HTTP requests which can be pipelined 
	until the connection is closed by the server. Setting this 
	attribute to 1 will disable HTTP/1.0 keep-alive, as well 
	as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipelining. Setting this to -1 
	will allow an unlimited amount of pipelined or keep-alive 
	HTTP requests. If not specified, this attribute is set to 100.
