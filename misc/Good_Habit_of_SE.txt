1. Keep reading existing source code 

2. Complete your document before next step
   Where is the Requirements Specification?
   Where is the Impact Analysis Document?
   Where is the Design Document?
   Have you documented all the assumptions, limitations properly?
   Have you done review of all the documents?
   Did you get sign off on all the documents from all the stakeholders?
3. Follow the defined standards, don't create it

4. Code should be written to be reviewed

5. Testing to be followed like a religion
   If you don't want to follow it, you will be in trouble.
   Celebrate every bug you find:
     Bugs are your enemies, so you have killed one.
	 Now your software is having one bug less.
	 Mistakes are good as long as they are not repeating.
	 What you learn today, prepares you for tomorrow
	 

6. Keep your code and document safe

7. Keep your tools&techniques handy

8. Leaving the ego behind, be eager to learn
