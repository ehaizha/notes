1. Reactor is a lightweight library for reactive programming. 
   It provides reactive variables which automatically update 
   themselves when the things they depend on change. This is
   similar to how a spreadsheet works, where cells can automatically 
   change their own values in reaction to changes in other cells.

2. Reactor has just 2 components: signals and observers

   Signals are values that are expected to change over time. Signals can depend on each other.
   Observers are functions which are triggered on signal changes.
