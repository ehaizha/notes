7. == vs ===
	Using the == operator (Equality)

	true == 1; //true, because 'true' is converted to 1 and then compared
	"2" == 2;  //true, because "2" is converted to 2 and then compared
	Using the === operator (Identity)

	true === 1; //false
	"2" === 2;  //false
	This is because the equality operator == does type coercion, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.

	On the other hand, the identity operator === does not do type coercion, and thus does not convert the values when comparing.
