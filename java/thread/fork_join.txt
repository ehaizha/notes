1. fork and join
   To support the fork and join in multiple thread java provide the following class:
   
   java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask: with return value, it implement the java.util.concurrent.Future and java.io.Serializable interface
   java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction: without return value
   User extend one of the about class to implement the fork and join logic.
   Use fork() method to divide the task to small task
   Use join() method to get the result
   
   java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool
   use the pool to invoke the forkjointask or forkjoinaction
